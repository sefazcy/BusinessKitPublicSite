---

## v4.4 — Booking Form & Contact Fix

### Contact page endpoint fix

- [ ] Navigate to `/contact`, fill in Full Name, Email, and Message, click "Send Message"
- [ ] In DevTools Network tab: the request goes to `POST /api/contact-messages` (not `/api/contact`)
- [ ] On success: green "Message sent!" screen appears; form fields are cleared
- [ ] If backend returns a validation error (e.g., invalid email format): the exact backend error message is shown in the red error banner (not a generic fallback)
- [ ] "Send another message" button resets back to the empty form
- [ ] No `Authorization` header is present on the contact request

### Booking page — service loading

- [ ] Navigate to `/booking` — brief "Loading services…" text is shown while services fetch
- [ ] With backend running and active services: the booking form appears with a service select dropdown
- [ ] With backend down: "Unable to load services…" error message shown with a "Contact us to book" link — no form is shown
- [ ] With backend running but no active services: "No services are currently available for online booking." message shown with a "Contact us to book" link — no form is shown

### Booking form — fields and layout

- [ ] Form is displayed inside a white card with a subtle border and shadow
- [ ] Service select shows a placeholder option "— Select a service —" by default
- [ ] Each option in the service select shows: `{title} — {X} min — ${Y.YY}`
- [ ] After selecting a service, a hint line appears below the select showing duration and price
- [ ] Date input enforces a minimum of today — past dates cannot be selected
- [ ] Time input is an HTML time picker (HH:mm)
- [ ] Contact details section has a subtle divider labelled "Your contact details"
- [ ] Full Name and Email are in a two-column row on desktop; stack on mobile
- [ ] Phone is a full-width field
- [ ] Notes / Additional Notes is an optional textarea (no asterisk)
- [ ] Required fields are marked with `*`
- [ ] Submit button text is "Request Appointment"
- [ ] A disclaimer below the button explains that the team will confirm by phone or email

### Booking form — client-side validation

All validations fire on submit; no API call is made if any fails.

- [ ] Submit with no service selected → "Please select a service."
- [ ] Submit with service but no date → "Please choose a preferred date."
- [ ] Submit with service + date but no time → "Please choose a preferred time."
- [ ] Submit with all date/time/service filled but no Full Name → "Please enter your full name."
- [ ] Submit with Full Name but no Email → "Please enter your email address."
- [ ] Submit with invalid email (e.g. `notanemail`) → "Please enter a valid email address."
- [ ] Submit with valid email but no Phone → "Please enter your phone number."
- [ ] Validation error appears in a red banner above the form; form fields retain their values
- [ ] Fixing the invalid field and resubmitting clears the error and proceeds to API call

### Booking form — successful submission

- [ ] Fill all required fields with valid data; click "Request Appointment"
- [ ] Button shows "Sending request…" while in flight; all form fields become unresponsive
- [ ] On success: the form is replaced by a green success message
  - [ ] "Booking request received!" heading is shown
  - [ ] Customer's full name appears in the confirmation text
  - [ ] Service title appears in the confirmation text
  - [ ] Requested date and time appear in the confirmation text
  - [ ] Reference number (appointment ID) is shown
- [ ] "Book another appointment" button resets to the empty form
- [ ] "Go to home" link navigates to `/`

### Booking form — backend error

- [ ] With backend running, submit with a date in the past (bypass the HTML `min` with DevTools if needed) — backend returns 400; error message from the backend is shown in a red banner above the form; form fields are preserved

### DevTools checks (Network tab)

- [ ] `POST /api/appointments` is called on booking submit
- [ ] Request body contains exactly:
  - `customerFullName` (string)
  - `customerEmail` (string or `null` if left blank — email is required by validation so always a string here)
  - `customerPhone` (string)
  - `staffMemberId`: `null`
  - `businessServiceId` (number, not a string)
  - `requestedDate` (string, format `YYYY-MM-DD`)
  - `requestedTime` (string, format `HH:mm`)
  - `note` (string or `null`)
- [ ] No `Authorization` header is present on the booking request
- [ ] Response is 201 with the created appointment object (id, customerFullName, businessServiceTitle, requestedDate, requestedTime, status)

### Regression checks

- [ ] All v4.3 routes still load: `/`, `/services`, `/gallery`, `/blog`, `/contact`
- [ ] Header and Footer are unchanged on all pages
- [ ] Home page still loads services and gallery previews from the backend
- [ ] Services page still loads and shows the "Book" button on each service
- [ ] `npm run build` completes with zero TypeScript errors and zero Vite warnings

### Known limitations (v4.4)

- No real-time availability checking — any date and time can be submitted
- `staffMemberId` is always sent as `null` (staff selection is not exposed to customers yet)
- Payment checkout is now automatic after booking (v4.6) — see v4.6 section below
- No email confirmation sent to customer (backend email integration is separate)
- Blog post detail page (`/blog/:slug`) still reuses the list page (no detail view yet)

---

## v4.6 — Payment Flow (Booking → Checkout → Status Page)

### Build

- [ ] `npm run build` completes with zero TypeScript errors and zero Vite warnings
- [ ] `dist/` folder is generated successfully

---

### Booking page — automatic checkout after booking

- [ ] Navigate to `/booking`, fill in all required fields, click "Request Appointment"
- [ ] On success: "Booking request received!" green card is shown as before
- [ ] A spinner with "Setting up payment session…" text appears below the booking confirmation while checkout is loading
- [ ] Once checkout resolves, the spinner is replaced by a **payment info card** that shows:
  - Amount (e.g., `150.00 TRY`)
  - A status badge: `Pending` (amber/yellow background)
  - A "View payment status →" link
- [ ] "View payment status →" link navigates to `/payment-status/{paymentId}`
- [ ] "Book another appointment" and "Go to home" buttons are still visible below the payment card
- [ ] Clicking "Book another appointment" resets everything — the form reappears and checkout state is cleared

---

### Booking → checkout API calls (DevTools Network tab)

- [ ] `POST /api/appointments` is called first and returns 201
- [ ] Immediately after, `POST /api/payments/checkout` is called with body `{ "appointmentId": <id> }`
- [ ] Both requests go to `http://localhost:5299`
- [ ] **No `Authorization` header** is present on either request
- [ ] No card data is collected or sent at any point
- [ ] `POST /api/payments/checkout` returns `{ paymentId, appointmentId, amount, currency, status, provider, checkoutUrl, message }`

---

### Booking page — checkout failure handling

- [ ] Simulate checkout failure (stop backend between booking submit and checkout call, or return 404 for the appointment)
- [ ] The booking success card ("Booking request received!") remains fully visible
- [ ] The payment info card is replaced by an **amber warning box** with:
  - "Payment setup could not be started automatically."
  - A message explaining the booking is still confirmed and to contact them for payment
- [ ] "Book another appointment" and "Go to home" buttons are still functional
- [ ] No white screen or app crash occurs

---

### Route: /payment-status/:paymentId

- [ ] Navigating to `/payment-status/3` (replace `3` with a real payment ID) loads the **Payment Status page**
- [ ] Page hero shows "Payment Status" heading
- [ ] "Loading payment status…" is shown while the API call is in flight
- [ ] On success: a card appears with the payment badge and payment ID

**Invalid ID:**

- [ ] `/payment-status/abc` → "Invalid payment ID." error message shown with "Back to booking" and "Home" links
- [ ] `/payment-status/99999` (non-existent) → "Payment with id 99999 was not found." error message shown
- [ ] "Try again" button on the error state re-fetches the status

---

### Payment Status Page — Pending state

- [ ] Badge shows "Awaiting payment" with **amber/yellow** background
- [ ] Payment ID is shown (e.g., "Payment #3")
- [ ] A description paragraph explains payment is pending
- [ ] **"Refresh status"** button is visible (indigo/primary style)
- [ ] Clicking "Refresh status": button briefly shows "Refreshing…" and is disabled; on completion, the status updates if it changed
- [ ] "Book another" and "Home" links are visible

**Developer tools panel (dev/test only):**

- [ ] An amber dashed-border panel labelled "Developer tools" is visible when status is Pending
- [ ] The panel description mentions the backend `simulate-paid` endpoint
- [ ] "Simulate successful payment" button is visible (amber background, distinct from primary actions)
- [ ] No `Authorization` header is sent when clicking "Simulate successful payment"

---

### Payment Status Page — simulating payment success

- [ ] Click "Simulate successful payment" in the dev panel
- [ ] Button shows "Simulating…" and is disabled while in flight
- [ ] On success: the page **updates to Paid state** without a full page reload
  - Badge changes to "Payment completed" with **green** background
  - "Paid at" row appears with the timestamp
  - The dev panel **disappears** (only shown for Pending)
  - "Refresh status" button disappears
  - "Book another" and "Home" links remain

---

### Payment Status Page — Paid state

- [ ] Badge shows "Payment completed" with **green** background
- [ ] "Paid at" label and timestamp are shown
- [ ] "Your payment has been received. Thank you!" description is shown
- [ ] No "Refresh status" button
- [ ] No dev panel
- [ ] "Book another" and "Home" links are shown

---

### Payment Status Page — other statuses (manual backend test)

Using admin panel or backend Swagger to force a specific status:

- [ ] **Failed**: badge shows "Payment failed" with **red** background; description mentions contacting for help
- [ ] **Refunded**: badge shows "Payment refunded" with **purple** background; description mentions processing time

---

### DevTools checks

- [ ] `GET /api/payments/{id}/status` is called on PaymentStatusPage load (no token)
- [ ] `PATCH /api/payments/{id}/simulate-paid` is called when "Simulate successful payment" is clicked (no token)
- [ ] After simulate, `GET /api/payments/{id}/status` is called again to refresh the displayed status
- [ ] `GET /api/payments/{id}/status` is called again when "Refresh status" is clicked
- [ ] No `Authorization` header is present on any payment status page request
- [ ] Response from status endpoint contains exactly: `id`, `status`, `paidAt` — no other fields

---

### Regression checks

- [ ] All v4.3 and v4.4 routes still load: `/`, `/services`, `/gallery`, `/blog`, `/contact`
- [ ] Booking form still works end-to-end (v4.4 flow unchanged up to the checkout addition)
- [ ] Contact form still submits to `/api/contact-messages`
- [ ] Header and Footer appear on the Payment Status page
- [ ] Navigating to an unknown URL still shows the NotFoundPage
- [ ] `npm run build` completes with zero TypeScript errors and zero Vite warnings

---

### Known limitations (v4.6)

- Payment Status page is not linked from header nav (it is a contextual page, navigated via the booking flow)
- "Simulate successful payment" dev button is publicly accessible — not gated behind authentication or environment check (intentional for this sprint; future hardening will gate it)
- No automatic polling on the Payment Status page — customer must click "Refresh status" manually
- `checkoutUrl` from the backend points to `http://localhost:5174/payment-status/{paymentId}` (placeholder URL from manual provider); in a real provider integration this will be a hosted checkout URL
- If backend returns currency other than TRY (from BusinessSettings), the amount is displayed with that currency code — no locale formatting
